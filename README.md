Emotion Sentiment Analyzer 🧠💬
This repository contains three deep learning models — RNN, LSTM, and GRU — implemented using Jupyter notebooks to perform emotion-based sentiment analysis on text data. The models are designed to classify text into various emotional categories such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, etc.

📁 Notebooks Included
RNN_model.ipynb

Implements a basic Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture.

Serves as a baseline for comparison with more advanced models like LSTM and GRU.

LSTM.ipynb

Builds upon the RNN with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units to handle longer dependencies.

Performs better on sequential data due to its gated memory structure.

GRU_model.ipynb

Uses Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), a lightweight alternative to LSTM.

Offers competitive performance with faster training times.

📊 Dataset
All three models are trained and evaluated on a labeled emotion dataset (not included in this repo). Each entry in the dataset consists of:

A text sample (e.g., a sentence or tweet).

A corresponding emotion label (e.g., happy, angry, surprised).

You can use datasets like the Emotion Dataset from Hugging Face or any other labeled emotion dataset.

🛠️ Features
Text preprocessing with tokenization and padding

Embedding layer using pre-trained or custom embeddings

Sequential model training using TensorFlow/Keras

Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Loss plots

Comparative analysis between RNN, LSTM, and GRU models

📈 Results
Model	Accuracy	Training Time	Notes
RNN	~65-70%	Fast	Basic baseline
LSTM	~75-80%	Moderate	Handles long dependencies well
GRU	~75-78%	Faster than LSTM	Similar performance with less computation
